# Team 15: Moving Site

At the beginning and the end of semesters, students hurry to pack up their stuff and move out. Many times, stuff is left behind in hopes that suitcases will close. To help reduce waste and ease these transitional periods, create a platform that will identify and sort these items for students and those who have just graduated to help furnish their new homes!

Your goal is to design a website or app that allows users to seamlessly browse and purchase a variety of goods. These offerings could look like connecting students moving out with incoming students who need furniture and essentials, rentals for large/seasonal items (mini-fridges, microwaves, bikes, skis, hammocks, etc.) for short-term use, or trading in school supplies (textbooks, iPads, laptops, and stationery).
